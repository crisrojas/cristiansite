title: La farsa del activismo en l√≠nea

En esos sitios, especialmente en reddit, la idea de activismo ha sido reducida a simplemente responder a un post.

On those sites, and especially on reddit, the idea of activism has been reduced to simple acknowledging/replying to a post, ostensibly made to "raise awareness". One of the ways the internet had a great deal of potential, which we did get to see in action for a brief period of its existence, was that it allowed people who were actually taking action and attempting to affect change, to communicate with a lot more people and across great distances. Now, that aspect of the internet has essentially been claimed and is exclusively utilized by corporate entities and political factions. And they have become obscenely sophisticated, infiltrating some discussions, imitating discourse elsewhere, sponsoring and dictating others. It has become essentially inescapable.
